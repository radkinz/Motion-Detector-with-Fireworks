# Motion-Detector-with-Fireworks
A program that uses computer vision to track objects based on color. The user can select an object from within the range of the computer's camera, and the program will then begin to track all of those objects it detects based off the user's selection. When those objects are detected close together, a firework will display in the rightside canvas.
